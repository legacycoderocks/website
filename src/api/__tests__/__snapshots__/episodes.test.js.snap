Alok gives us a deep insight into his tripartite approach to rationalizing, selecting, planning, and managing technology in small to mid-sized organizations. After discussing the three key elements of his analytical approach -- people, processes, and data -- he explains why understanding people takes precedence over the two other components if a project is to succeed. When you finish listening to this episode, check out Alok's <a href= "https://www.sharmaanalytics.com/blog">video blog</a> which gives many insights to managers on how they should think about technology in their organizations.</p>",
