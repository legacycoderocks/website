If you're like a lot of people, when you hear the words "legacy code" it conjures up images of big mainframes and archaic punch card machines. While that's true — it only tells a small part of the story. The truth is, the code you leave behind is your legacy, so let's make it a good one.]]></itunes:summary>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all strive to write an ideal code - easily readable, functional, and clean. We use many tools to achieve this.

Sam is a natural teacher, and he enjoys sharing what he learned with others. We talk with Sam about the tools and methods that make our code clean - refactoring, retrospectives, and style guides.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the biggest risks for cyber security frameworks come from employees meant to maintain them. The reason for that is simple, and it couldn't be more human - people who don't feel well don't perform well. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today we talk with</span> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nyotagordon/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Nyota Gordon</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">, the founder, developer, and all-around do-gooder at</span> <a href= "https://transition365.com/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Transition365</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">, a cyber resiliency firm that helps cybersecurity professionals increase their leadership and life skills.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nyota digs deep into the intersection between cyber security, resiliency, and personal wellness.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We like to think that technology is our objective and neutral assistant, our faithful lieutenant constrained with science and armed with cold, hard data. But this is incorrect. Technology reflects the attitudes of humans who created it. It contains our biases and our preconceived notions. It reflects who we are while distorting our perception of who we think we are, transforming our impulse for binary simplifications into the strict binary framework of ones and zeroes.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As menders working with legacy code, we are focused on identifying and reducing technical debt. But how much easier this task would be if the creator of the code or the previous maintainer left us some breadcrumbs to follow? A simple note on the rationale for a particular decision they have made or a warning about interconnected lines of code would take us a long way! Today we talk with</span> <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreamgoulet/"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Andrea Goulet</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Corgibytes. Her empathy-driven approach to software development earned her recognition as one of the Top Ten Professionals in Software Under 35 by LinkedIn. She tells us about this lack of communication in software development, the phenomenon she calls the communication debt, and how its reduction can make the software more robust and its maintenance more efficient.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most, if not all, of the legacy projects feature monolithic application architectures. However, moving to containers can bring many benefits: consistency down the pipeline, no-touch deployment, better support for decomposing the monolith - to name just a few. Today we talk with our own</span> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benrj"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Ben Johnson</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many causes of technical debt - unknown or ill-defined requirements, business pressures to deliver fast, procedural deficiencies during development, and many more. These are often just manifestations of a larger problem - lack of understanding due to limitations of natural language and inability to predict future social and technical developments. Today we talk with</span> <a href= "https://twitter.com/einarwh?lang=en"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Einar W.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many causes of technical debt - unknown or ill-defined requirements, business pressures to deliver fast, procedural deficiencies during development, and many more. These are often just manifestations of a larger problem - lack of understanding due to limitations of natural language and inability to predict future social and technical developments. Today we talk with <a href= "https://twitter.com/einarwh?lang=en">Einar W. Høst</a>, a programmer at the <a href= "https://www.nrk.no/">NRK</a>, Norwegian public broadcasting company, about these sociolinguistic causes of technical debt.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you ever feel like we are entering the age of democratization of software development?

James shares with us his passion for low-code platforms - software applications designed to provide a software development environment through GUI and model-driven logic, instead of hard coding. What are their advantages, and where are their limits? When are they useful, and when do they become a liability? James' answers to these questions will help you navigate this incoming disruption.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coding with empathy is one of the Corgibytes' core principles, underlying everything we talk about on this show.

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To paraphrase Lewellyn Falco, when one person is programming, it is that person's best ideas that are being encoded into the software; when two people are programming together, you get the best ideas from both of them.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To paraphrase Lewellyn Falco, when one person is programming, it is that person's best ideas that are being encoded into the software; when two people are programming together, you get the best ideas from both of them. Today we are talking with Harald Reingruber, a software engineer who specializes in visual and spatial computing, about his upcoming pair-programming tour in the US and Canada. Where is he planning to go; how will he travel; who will he pair with; and what benefits pair-programming can bring to you and your team?

      <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time, we focus on a specific aspect of software development and maintenance and try to see how these small pieces fit in the big picture of working with legacy code. Not today, however. Today we talk with</span> <a href= "https://twitter.com/abrahammarin?lang=en"><span style= "font-weight: 400;">Abraham Marín-Pérez</span></a><span style= "font-weight: 400;">, an extremely active Java developer with more than ten years of experience in various industries, about THE big picture and why legacy code rocks!
