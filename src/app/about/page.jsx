      <h2>About the Podcast</h2>
      <p>
        The Legacy Code Rocks podcast was created in 2016 in hopes that we
        could change the way developers and others engage with and talk
        about software systems that they inherit by others. Founders{' '}
        <a href="https://andreagoulet.com/">Andrea Goulet</a> and{' '}
        <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/mscottford">M. Scott Ford</a>{' '}
        thought that they would make an attempt by having great conversations
        with others who are also passionate about maintaining software.
      </p>
      <p>
        So often, people use <em>legacy code</em> as a pejorative term. The
        kind of thing that you never want to be accused of building, the
        kind of project that no one wants to touch, the kind of codebase
        that devs are eager to rewrite from scratch. This is the kind of
        mentality that this show is out to shift.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most episodes are less than 1 hour long. We&apos;ve
        published {episodeCount} episodes so far, and we still have a lot more
        that we&apos;d like to explore and say.
